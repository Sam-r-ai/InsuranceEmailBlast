I hope this reaches you in time â€” I was just reviewing my file list, and your name popped up as someone who may still be eligible for the new California Life Insurance Programs with added living benefits.

These programs were created to help families like yours lock in permanent coverage that never expires and access your money early in case of a critical illness â€” something most older policies donâ€™t cover.

If you already have coverage, great â€” but most of the families I speak to are shocked to find out:

Their policies expire or increase in price as they age

They canâ€™t access any of the money if something happens while theyâ€™re still alive

Theyâ€™re paying more than they should without realizing it

If you want to see how these new options compare to what you currently have (or what you could qualify for), I can send you a personalized breakdown. Just reply to this email or call/text me directly.

ðŸ•’ Time-sensitive: I only have access to your file for a short period before it gets closed out.

Talk soon,
